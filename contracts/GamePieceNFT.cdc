/// GamePieceNFT
///
/// In this contract, we defined an NFT designed for use in games.
/// The primary differentiation between this and standard NFTs is the
/// mapping of GamingMetadataViews.BasicWinLossRetriever Capabilities
/// and the function addWinLossRetriever() which is included so that
/// games in which the NFT is used can add said Capability. This pattern
/// emerged as a way to enable win/loss data for games where the NFT is
/// played to be mutated by the games and enable the NFT to maintain
/// win/loss data for any game in which it's played without the need for
/// the owner to pay for the storage of that win/loss data.
///
/// We hope that this pattern can be built on for more complex gaming
/// applications with more complex metadata as a powerful method for 
/// defining attributes that can be mutated, but in a manner that ensures
/// mutation is only performed by the game in which the NFT is played.
