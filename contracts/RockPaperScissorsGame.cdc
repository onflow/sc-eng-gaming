/// RockPaperScissorsGame
///
/// This contract defines the logic of a game of Rock Paper Scissors
/// and resources to support gameplay between two players as well 
/// as resources to receive and maintain gameplay Capabilities.
///
/// Gameplay occurs through Match resources in which players
/// must escrow their NFT for the length of the Match
/// or until the Match timeLimit is reached. New Matches are stored
/// in this contract's account storage to provide a neutral party
/// in which NFTs are escrowed during the course of play.
///
/// When a Match is created, MatchLobbyActions allow players to 
/// escrow their NFTs while MatchPlayerActions allows players
/// to submit their moves and request that escrowed NFTs be returned.
/// Any game assets necessary to retrieve NFT win/loss records &
/// maintain assigned moves are added to the escrowed NFTs as attachments.
///
/// To maintain the player's Capabilities, the GamePlayer
/// resource is included in this contract. GamePlayers can create new
/// Matches, but must escrow an NFT to do so (to limit spam Match
/// creation).
///
/// This contract is designed to be built upon by others in a composable
/// manner, so please create your own Matches, combine logic and Moves
/// from this game contract with other game contracts in other Matches
/// and tournaments, and get creative to build a thriving community of
/// composable games on Flow!
