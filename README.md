# Rock Paper Scissors On-Chain | (ü™® üìÉ ‚úÇÔ∏è) - ‚õìÔ∏è

> :warning: This repo is a WIP aiming to showcase how Auth Account capabilities from [FLIP 53](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/53) could be use to achieve Hybrid Custody in practice. The `LinkedAccounts` & supporting contracts are representative of the last stable implementation of Hybrid Custody contracts and will soon be replaced by those found in [this repo](https://github.com/Flowtyio/restricted-child-account) where development is ongoing.

This repo originated as an on-chain Rock Paper Scissors game as a proof of concept exploration into the world of blockchain gaming powered by Cadence on Flow, and ended up turning into a sandbox for turning [Hybrid Custody](https://flow.com/hybrid-custody) into a reality.

The contents in this repo are the on-chain components powering the [Walletless Arcade](https://walletless-arcade-game.vercel.app/).

In addition to on-chain gaming, you'll find a number of novel Cadence implemenations including:

- üîó Linked accounts
- üì≤ Walletless onboarding
- üèÜ Dynamic NFTs

# Overview

As gaming makes its way into Web 3.0, bringing with it the next swath of mainstream users, we created this repo as a playground to develop proof of concept implementations that showcase the power of on-chain games built with the Cadence resource-oriented programming language. Through this exploration, we discovered the importance of improving onboarding, reducing friction in dApp user experience, and so iterated our way to an initial [hybrid custody model](https://flow.com/post/flow-blockchain-mainstream-adoption-easy-onboarding-wallets). It's our hope that the work and exploration here uncovers unique design patterns that are useful towards composable game designs and, more broadly, novel custody models, helping to pave the way for a thriving community of developers building the best dApps in the world on Flow.

For our first proof of concept game, we've created the `RockPaperScissorsGame` and supporting contract `GamingMetadataViews`.

As a learning ground for upcoming Cadence Attachments, we wanted to demonstrate how NFT metadata could be altered via gameplay in an entirely separate contract than it was defined. So we created `DynamicNFT` which contains interfaces for attachments & receivers for those attachments. 

The attachment receiver portion of that model is implemented in `GamePieceNFT` (modeled heavily after [`MonsterMaker`](https://github.com/onflow/monster-maker)) and the attachments are implemented in `RockPaperScissorsGame`.

Taken together with any NFT implementing `DynamicNFT`, these contracts define an entirely on-chain game with a dynamic NFT that accesses an ongoing record of its win/loss data via native Cadence attachments added to the NFT upon escrow.

While there are many interpretations of what an on-chain game should look like, this repo focusses on on-chain, player-mediated gameplay along. This game contract suite is then taken as an application on which Hybrid Custody is layered, enabling for seamless *and* primarily on-chain gameplay while offering users a path to real ownership of in-app assets.

We believe that smart contract-powered gaming is not only possible, but that it will add to the gaming experience and unlock totally new mechanisms of gameplay. Imagine a world where games require minimal, if any, backend support - just a player interfacing with an open-sourced local client making calls to a smart contract. Player's get maximum transparency, trustlessness, verifiability, and total ownership of their game assets. By leveraging the new Hybrid Custody model, the UX and custodial challenges inherent to building on-chain games are alleviated, empowering developers to push the boundaries of in-game asset ownership, platform interoperability, and data & resource composability.

With a community of open-source developers building on a shared blockchain, creativity could be poured into in-game experiences via community supported game clients while all players rest assured that their game assets are secured and core game logic remains unchanged.

Game leaderboards emerge as inherent to the architecture of a publicly queryable blockchain. Game assets and logic designed for use in one game can be used as building blocks in another, while matches and tournaments could be defined to have real stakes and rewards.

The entirety of that composable gaming future is possible on Flow, and starts with the simple proof of concept defined in this repo. We hope you dive in and are inspired to build more fun and complex games using the learnings, patterns, and maybe even resources in these contracts!

## Gameplay Overview

To showcase this promised composability, we constructed contracts to support a multi-dApp experience starting with a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS). Straightforward enough, players can engage in single or two-player single round matches of RPS. After configuring their `GamePlayer` resource, users can start a match by escrowing a `GamePieceNFT`. The match is playable once both players have escrowed their NFTs (or after the first player to escrow if in single player mode). The escrowed NFT gets an attachment enabling retrieval of its win/loss record and another that maintains the playable moves for the game - rock, paper, and scissors, as expected.

Once playable, the match proceeds in stages - commit and resolve (to be replaced by a commit-reveal pattern to obfuscate on-chain moves). Players first must commit their moves. After both players have submitted moves, the match can be resolved. On resolution, a winner is determined and the associated NFT's win/loss record is amended with the match results.

Of course, once the match is over (or if a timeout is reached without resolution) the escrowed NFTs can then be returned to their respective escrowing players.

Things get much more interesting when the on-chain game is coupled with a Hybrid Custody app experience, as seen in [this demo](https://walletless-arcade-game.vercel.app/). To facilitate a fuller game experience in said dApp, `TicketToken` was introduced as a player reward for winning matches, just like an arcade. 

The accompanying `TicketToken` and `ArcadePrize` contracts aren't special in and of themselves - simple FT and NFT contracts. However, once a user links their wallet with the app account used to play the game - the account issued `TicketToken` on match wins - the authenticated account is issued an AuthAccount Capability on the app account. This on-chain linking between accounts establishes what we'll call a "parent-child" hierarchy between user accounts where the user's wallet mediated account is the "parent" to the partitioned "child" account.

After linking, the user can authenticate in a dApp using their parent account, and any dApp leveraging the resources in the `LinkedAccounts` contract can identify all associated child accounts, their contents, and facilitate transactions interacting with child-account custodied assets with a transaction signed by the parent account alone.

To demonstrate this, `ArcadePrize` accepts `TicketToken` redemption for minting NFTs. Redeeming FTs for NFTs isn't new, but the ability to sign a transaction with one account and, using delegated AuthAccount Capabilities, acquire funds from another to mint an NFT to the signing account is new. This setup introduces account models similar to Web2's app authorization into our decentralized Web3 context.

This small use case unlocks a whole world of possibilities, merging walled garden custodial dApps with self-custodial wallets enabling ecosystem-wide composability and unified asset management. Users can engage with hybrid custody apps seamlessly, then leave their assets in app accounts, sign into a marketplace and redeem in-app currencies and NFTs without the need to first transfer to the account they plan on spending or listing from.

# Components

## Gaming
* **GamingMetadataViews** - Defining the metadata structs relevant to an NFT's win/loss data and assigned moves as well as interfaces designed to be implemented as attachments for NFTs. These interfaces enable the implementing contracts to alter values associated with data on an NFT's attachments via limited access control, a useful feature for smart contract game development, among other use cases.

* **RockPaperScissorsGame** - As you might imagine, this contract contains the game's moves, logic as well as resources and interfaces defining the rules of engagement in the course of a match. Additionally, receivers for Capabilities to matches are defined in `GamePlayer` resource and interfaces that allow players to create matches, be added and add others to matches, and engage with the matches they're in. The `Match` resource is defined as a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors that can be played in either single or two player modes, with single-player modes randomizing the second player's move on a contract function call.

## Hybrid Custody

> :warning: Note that the details related to Hybrid Custody are in flux and a new design has been accepted, with development underway in [this repo](https://github.com/Flowtyio/restricted-child-account)

* **LinkedAccounts** - The resources enabling linked accounts are defined within this contract, implementing NFT and MetadataViews standards. Users are onboarded by abtracting away account creation, including funding the creation of new accounts. Once a user links their main account, relevant resources are tagged with pertinent metadata (`LinkedAccountMetadataViews.Accountetadata`) in a `LinkedAccounts.Handler`. A parent account maintains a `Collection` which captures any linked child accounts' `AuthAccount` and `Handler` Capabilities in an `NFT`, indexing the nested resource on the child account's address.

## Supporting
* **DynamicNFT** - This contract defines interfaces for attachments & resources which receive those attachments as nested resources as well as resolve metadata related those attachments.
* **GamePieceNFT** - An example NFT implementation of `DynamicNFT`, [featuring png's seen elsewhere](https://monster-maker-web-client.vercel.app/) in Flow demos, and used to demonstrate NFT escrow in `RockPaperScissorsGame` gameplay.
* **TicketToken** - A simple FungibleToken implementation intended for use as redemption tokens in exchange for `ArcadePrize` NFTs
* **ArcadePrize** - Another example implementation, this time of a NonFungibleToken. Minting requires `TicketToken` redemption. An interesting note, you can redeem

## Composition
Taking a look at `RockPaperScissorsGame`, you'll see that it stands on its own - a user with any `DynamicNFT` can engage with the game to play single and multiplayer matches. The same goes for `TicketToken` and `GamePieceNFT` contracts in that they are independent components not necessarily designed to be used together. We created each set of contracts as composable building blocks and put them together to create a unique dApp experience, incorporating ChildAccounts as a middle layer abstracting user identity from a single account to a network of associated accounts. 

One more consideration comes from the contract's acceptance of any NFT. While this maximizes openness, it also means that NFTs with the same ID cause collisions in the win/loss record mapping indexed on escrowed NFT IDs. This shouldn't be an issue for NFTs that assign ids on UUIDs, but users could experience a case where they effectively share a win/loss record with another NFT of the same ID. This could be handled by indexing on the hash of an NFT's ID along with its Type which should yield a unique value or alternatively, the NFTs UUID. The latter would be a harder ask as it's unlikely a requestor would have the NFT's UUID on hand if it's not already the equivalent to its ID.

A bit of a note on best practices...it's evident that defining on-chain game logic must involve some degree of adversarial thinking. For example, we could have (and did at one point) include `returnPlayerNFTs()` in `resolveMatch()` to remove the need for an additional call. However, we discovered that a malicious `Receiver` could `panic` on `deposit()` which would prevent `Match` resolution. This along with the revelation that I could assure game outcomes with the afforementioned post-condition on results led us to the commit-resolve pattern you see in the contracts & transactions.

# User Walkthrough

With the context and components explained, we can more closely examine how they interact in an end-to-end user experience. For simplicity, we'll assume everything goes as it's designed and walk the happy path.

## Onboarding
With linked accounts, there are two ways a user can onboard.

- üåà **"Wallet-less" onboarding** - First, a dApp can onboard a user with Web2 credentials, creating a Flow account for the user and abstracting away key management.

- üîó **"Blockchain-native" onboarding flow** - Second, a user native to the Flow ecosystem can connect their wallet and start the dApp experience with controll over the app account. In our version, the dApp will still abstract key management, but will additionally delegate control over the app account to the user's authenticated account via AuthAccount Capabilities.

### Wallet-less Onboarding

After a user authenticates via some traditional Web2 authentication mechanism, the dApp initiates walletless onboarding

1. A new public/private key pair is generated
1. Providing the generated public key, initial funding amount, and `MonsterComponent` values, the walletless onboarding transaction starts by creating a new account from the signer's `AccountCreator` resource.

    :warning: Note that any old account creation mechanism can be used in your walletless onboarding flow, but this resource allowed us to query created addresses from custodied keys.

1. A `GamePieceNFT` Collection is configured in the new account
1. The signer mints a `GamePieceNFT` to the new account's Collection
1. A `GamePlayer` resource is configured in the new account so it can play `RockPaperScissorsGame.Match`es
1. A `TicketToken.Vault` is saved & linked in the new account

### Blockchain-native Onboarding

After a user's wallet has been connected, run the blockchain-native multisig onboarding transaction signed by both a developer account & the user. Note that this would require a backend account pre-configured with an `AccountCreator` & funded with FLOW to pay for new account creation, though account creation can be handled by many other mechanisms.

This onboarding transaction does the following.

1. Given a generated public key (private key managed by the game dev), funding amount, `AccountInfo` values, and `MonsterComponent` values
1. Creates a new account
1. Links an AuthAccount Capability in the new account's private storage
1. Configures the account with a `GamePieceNFT` Collection
1. Configures the new account with a `GamePlayer` resource
1. Sets up a `TicketToken` Vault in the new account
1. Sets up `GamePieceNFT.Collection` in the user's connected account
1. Sets up a `TicketToken.Vault` in the user's connected account
1. Configures a `LinkedAccounts.Collection` in the user's account
1. Mints a `GamePieceNFT` to the new account's `Collection`
1. Links the new account as a child of the user's account via the configured `LinkedAccounts.Collection`, giving the user delegated access of the newly created account

## Gameplay

- <details><summary>Single-Player Gameplay</summary>

    1. Player creates a new match, escrowing their NFT along with their NFT `Receiver`. Note that match timeout is established on creation, which prevents the escrowed NFT from being retrieved during gameplay.
        - `RPSAssignedMoves` and `RPSWinLossRetriever` are attached to their escrowed NFT if they are not already attached
    1. Player submits their move
    1. Player calls for automated player's move to be submitted
    1. In a separate transaction (enforced by block height), player calls `resolveMatch()` to determine the outcome of the `Match`
        1. The win/loss record is recorded for the player's NFT
        1. The win/loss record is recorded for the designated contract's `dummyNFTID`
        1. The escrowed NFT is returned to the escrowing player
    1. Player calls for escrowed NFT to be returned via `returnPlayersNFTs()`. Since the `Match` returns the escrowed NFTs directly via the given `Receiver` Capability, we made this a separate call to prevent malicious Capabilities from disallowing resolution. In this case, the worst a malicious Capability could do would be force the other player to call `retrieveUnclaimedNFT()` in order to have their NFT returned.
    </details>

- <details><summary>Multi-Player Gameplay</summary>

    1. Player one creates a new match, escrowing their NFT. Note that match timeout is established on creation, which prevents the escrowed NFT from being retrieved during gameplay.
        - `RPSAssignedMoves` and `RPSWinLossRetriever` are attached to their escrowed NFT if they are not already attached
    1. Player one adds `MatchLobbyActions` Capability to Player two's `GamePlayerPublic`
        1. Player one gets `GamePlayerPublic` Capability from Player two
        1. Player one calls `addPlayerToMatch()` on their `GamePlayer`, passing the `matchID` and the reference to Player two's `GamePlayerPublic`
    1. Player two escrows their NFT into the match
        1. `RPSAssignedMoves` and `RPSWinLossRetriever` are attached to their escrowed NFT if they are not already attached
    1. Each player submits their move
    1. After both moves have been submitted, any player can then call for match resolution
        1. A winner is determined
        1. The win/loss records are recorded for each NFT
        1. Each NFT is returned to their respective owners
    1. Any player calls for escrowed NFT to be returned via `returnPlayersNFTs()`. Since the `Match` returns the escrowed NFTs directly via the given `Receiver` Capability, we made this a separate call to prevent malicious Capabilities from disallowing resolution. In this case, the worst a malicious Capability could do would be to require that the other player call `retrieveUnclaimedNFT()` in a separate transaction to retrieve their singular NFT from escrow.
    </details>
    

## Edge Case Resolution

### **NFTs are escrowed, but the moves are never submitted**

Since a match timeout is specified upon `Match` creation and retrieval of `NFT`s is contingent on either the timeout being reached or the `Match` no longer being in play, a player can easily retrieve their `NFT` after timeout by calling `returnPlayerNFTs()` on their `MatchPlayerActions` Capability.

Since this Capability is linked on the game contract account which (in an actual stakes environment) shouldn't have active keys, the user can be assured that the Capability will not be unlinked. Additionally, since the method deposits the `NFT` to the `Receiver` provided upon escrow, they can be assured that it will not be accessible to anyone else calling `returnPlayerNFTs()`.

### **NFTs are escrowed, but player unlinks their `Receiver` Capability before the NFT could be returned**

In this edge case, the `Receiver` Capability provided upon escrowing would no longer be linked to the depositing player‚Äôs `Collection`. In this case, as long as the escrowing player still has their `GamePlayer`, they could call `retrieveUnclaimedNFT()`, providing a reference to their `GamePlayerID` and the `Receiver` they want their NFT returned to.

### **Player provides a Receiver Capability that panics in its deposit() method**

This wouldn't be encounterd by the `Match` until `returnPlayerNFTs()` is called after match resolution. Depending on the order of the `Receiver` Capabilities in the `nftReceivers` mapping, this could prevent the other player from retrieving their NFT via that function. At that point, however, the winner & loser have been decided and the game is over (`inPlay == false`). The other player could then call `retrieveUnclaimedNFT()` to retrieve the NFT that the trolling Receiver was preventing from being returned.

### **Player changes their mind after NFT escrow & before move submission**

In the event a player changes their mind after creating a match, they'd currently have to wait the length of timeout to call `returnPlayerNFTs()`. Changing this behavior is scoped as a future improvement to enable abandoning a match before initiating gameplay, likely only to be updated in singleplayer mode matches.

        ```sh
        flow scripts execute scripts/game_piece_nft/get_rps_win_loss.cdc <CHILD_ADDRESS> <NFT_ID>
        ```

### Connect Wallet & Link Accounts

There are two ways to go about this process. One involves a multi-signature transaction where both the existing app account (soon to be ‚Äúchild‚Äù account) and the user‚Äôs main account (soon to be ‚Äúparent‚Äù account) sign a transaction in which all changes are made. Another approach is to have the app account sign a transaction publishing its AuthAccount capability to then be claimed by the user‚Äôs account in a subsequent transaction.

For both the following transaction, you'll want to create an account if following along in flow-cli

```sh
flow accounts create # account name: parent | network: emulator
```

**Multi-Sig**

Both accounts sign a transaction, configuring a `ChildAccountManager` in the user‚Äôs main account and capturing the child account‚Äôs AuthAccount capability in said `ChildAccountManager`. The `GamePlayer` resource in the child account is moved to the now parent account and a `DelegatedGamePlayer` capability is granted to the child account, saved in it `ChildAccountTag`. 
In the end, the two accounts are linked by resource representation on-chain and both are configured such that the app has all it needs to play the game on behalf of the player and the user‚Äôs main account (AKA parent account) maintains an AuthAccount capability on the app account (AKA child account) so resources can be transferred from the child account without need for the app‚Äôs involvement.

3. Query for new account address from public key 
    * `child_account/get_child_address_from_public_key_on_creator: Address`
        1. `creatorAddress: Address`
        2. `pubKey: String`
    
    ```sh
    flow scripts execute scripts/linked_accounts/get_child_address_from_public_key_on_creator.cdc <CHILD_ADDRESS> <PUBLIC_KEY>
    ```
    

### Minting TicketToken

Based on Match results (queried above in `game_piece_nft/get_rps_win_loss`) and checked against the user's `GamePlayer.id` (queried in `rock_paper_scissors_game/get_game_player_id`), we‚Äôll want to mint tokens to the child account‚Äôs `TicketToken.Vault`. These tokens can be redeemed for an `ArcadePrize.NFT` later in the demo.

1. Mint tokens to the player‚Äôs app account
    * `ticket_token/mint_tokens`
        1. `recipient: Address`
        2. `amount: UFix64`
        
        ```sh
        flow transactions send transactions/ticket_token/mint_tokens.cdc <CHILD_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>
        ```
        
2. Query the balance of tokens in the account
    * `ticket_token/get_balance: UFix64` - panics if Vault is not configured
        * `of: Address`
    
    ```sh
    flow scripts execute scripts/ticket_token/get_balance.cdc <CHILD_ADDRESS>
    ```
    

### Minting ArcadePrize.NFT

In this section, we‚Äôll use the TicketToken.Vault in the child account to pay for an NFT to the signing account‚Äôs Collection. This serves as an example for how a dApp can present and utilize the assets in a connected account‚Äôs child account(s), creating a seamless experience compared to the fragmented UX previously inherent to isolated app accounts.

1. Query for the TicketToken.Vault.balance in each of the user‚Äôs child accounts
    1. `ticket_token/get_all_account_balances_from_storage: {Address: UFix64}`
        * `parentAddress: Address`
    
        ```sh
        flow scripts execute scripts/ticket_token/get_balance_of_all_child_accounts.cdc <PARENT_ADDRESS>
        ```
    
    1. `child_account/get_all_account_balances_from_storage: {Type: VaultInfo}`
        * `address: Address`
        
        ```sh
        fse scripts/linked_accounts/get_all_account_balances_from_storage.cdc <PARENT_ADDRESS>
        ```
        
        ```jsx
        // Where VaultInfo has the following interface
        pub struct VaultInfo {
            pub let name: String?
            pub let symbol: String?
            pub var balance: UFix64
            pub let description: String?
            pub let externalURL: String?
            pub let logos: MetadataViews.Medias?
            pub let storagePathIdentifier: String
            pub let receiverPathIdentifier: String?
            pub let providerPathIdentifier: String?
        
            pub fun addBalance(_ addition: UFix64)
        }
        ```
    
2. Query for all publicly accessible NFTs in the connected account & its child accounts
    * `child_account/get_all_nft_display_views_from_public: [NFTData]`
        * `address: Address`

    ```sh
    flow scripts execute scripts/linked_accounts/get_all_nft_display_views_from_storage.cdc <PARENT_ADDRESS>
    ```

    ```jsx
    // Where NFTData has the following interface
    pub struct NFTData {
        pub let name: String
        pub let description: String
        pub let thumbnail: String
        pub let resourceID: UInt64
        pub let ownerAddress: Address?
        pub let collectionName: String
        pub let collectionDescription: String
        pub let collectionURL: String
        pub let collectionStoragePathIdentifier: String?
        pub let collectionPublicPathIdentifier: String
    }
    ```

1. Mint a rainbow duck for 10.0 TicketTokens, redeeming the TicketTokens in the user‚Äôs child account & minting to the signer‚Äôs Collection
    * `arcade_prize/mint_rainbow_duck_paying_with_child_vault`
        1. `fundingChildAddress: Address`
        2. `minterAddress: Address`
    
    ```sh
    flow transactions send transactions/arcade_prize/mint_rainbow_duck_paying_with_child_vault.cdc <CHILD_ADDRESS> f8d6e0586b0a20c7 --signer parent
    ```
    
1. Again query for all publicly accessible NFTs in the connected account & its child accounts to see the NFT that was minted among all of the user‚Äôs owned NFTs
    * `child_account/get_all_nft_display_views_from_public: [NFTData]`
        * `address: Address`
    
    ```bash
    flow scripts execute scripts/linked_accounts/get_all_nft_display_views_from_storage.cdc <PARENT_ADDRESS>
    ```

# Play Self-Custodied on Testnet

The contracts in this repos have been deployed to 

If you want to play this game on testnet in a fully fledged Hybrid Custody dApp, check out our demo implementation [here](https://walletless-arcade-game.vercel.app/).

As for good old fashioned self-custody, while you won't be able to perform TicketToken minting, you can play RockPaperScissors Matches using your own wallet and NFTs. You could however use your own NFTs to engage with the contracts via Flow CLI, [FlowRunner](https://runflow.pratikpatel.io/) or [Raft](https://raft.page/nvdtf/welcome-to-raft). Here's how:

1. Onboard your account with GamePieceNFT Collection, NFT, & GamePlayer resource
    * `onboarding/self_custody_onboarding.cdc`
        * `minterAddress: Address`
    ```
    flow transactions send transactions/onboarding/self_custody_onboarding.cdc 917b2b1dafdcfa58 --signer <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME> --network testnet
    ```
    1. Check out your new resources on [FlowView](https://testnet.flowview.app/) & note your GamePlayer.id & NFT.id
1. After you have a Collection, NFT, & GamePlayer configured, you're ready to play the game!
    * `rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/setup_new_singleplayer_match.cdc`
        1. `submittingNFTID: UInt64`
        1. `matchTimeLimitInMinutes: UInt`
    ```
    flow transactions send transactions/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/setup_new_singleplayer_match.cdc <NFT_ID> <MATCH_TIMEOUT> --signer <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME> --network testnet
    ```
1. Submit your move & the randomized second player's move
    * `/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/submit_both_singleplayer_moves.cdc`
        1. `matchID: UInt64`
        1. `move: UInt8` - 0: rock, 1: paper, 2: scissors
    ```
    flow transactions send transactions/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/submit_both_singleplayer_moves.cdc <MATCH_ID> <MOVE> --signer <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME> --network testnet
    ```
1. Resolve the Match & return your NFT. Note that resolution needs to occur at least one block from when the last move was submitted.
    * `/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/resolve_match_and_return_nfts.cdc`
        * `matchID: UInt64`
    ```
    flow transactions send transactions/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/resolve_match_and_return_nfts.cdc <MATCH_ID> --signer <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME> --network testnet
    ```
    
1. Query the moves played for the Match
    * `rock_paper_scissors_game/get_match_move_history: {UInt64: RockPaperScissorsGame.SubmittedMove}?`
        * `matchID: UInt64`
    ```
    flow scripts execute scripts/rock_paper_scissors_game/get_match_move_history.cdc <MATCH_ID> --network testnet
    ```
1. You can additionally query your NFT's win/loss record
    * `game_piece_nft/get_rps_win_loss: GamingMetadataViews.BasicWinLoss?`
        1. `address: Address`
        2. `id: UInt64`
    ```
    flow scripts execute scripts/game_piece_nft/get_rps_win_loss.cdc <YOUR_ADDRESS> <NFT_ID> --network testnet
    ```
