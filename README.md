# Rock Paper Scissors (Mostly) On-Chain

**TODO - transaction diagrams & image URL on NFT**

Weâ€™re building an on-chain Rock Paper Scissors game as a proof of concept exploration into the world of blockchain gaming powered by Cadence on Flow.

## Overview

As gaming makes its way into Web 3.0, bringing with it the next swath of mainstream users, we created this repo as a playground to develop proof of concept implementations that showcase the power of on-chain games built with the Cadence resource-oriented programming language. It's our hope that the work and exploration here uncovers unique design patterns that are useful towards composable game designs, helping to pave the way for a thriving community of game developers on Flow.

For our first proof of concept game, we've created the `RockPaperScissorsGame` and supporting contracts `GamePieceNFT` and `GamingMetadataViews`. Taken together, these contracts define a mostly on-chain, centrally mediated game with a dynamic NFT that accesses an ongoing record of its win/loss data.

As this proof of concept is iteratively improved, we hope to create a host of reference examples demonstrating how game developers could build games on Flow - some entirely on-chain while others blend on and off-chain architectures along with considerations for each design.

We believe that smart contract-powered gaming is not only possible, but that it will add to the gaming experience and unlock totally new mechanisms of gameplay. Imagine a world where games don't require a backend - just a player interfacing with an open-sourced local client making calls to a smart contract. Player's get maximum transparency, trustlessness, verifiability, and total ownership of their game assets.

With a community of open-source developers building on a shared blockchain, creativity could be poured into in-game experiences via community supported game clients while all players rest assured that their game assets are secured and core game logic remains unchanged. Game leaderboards emerge as inherent to the architecture of a publicly queryable blockchain. Game assets and logic designed for use in one game can be used as building blocks in another, while matches and tournaments could be defined to have real stakes and rewards.

The entirety of that composable gaming future is possible on Flow, and starts with the simple proof of concept defined in this repo. We hope you dive in and are inspired to build more fun and complex games using the learnings, patterns, and maybe even resources in these contracts!

## Components

### **Summary**

As mentioned above, the supporting contracts for this game have been compartmentalized to three primary contracts. At a high level, those are:

* **GamingMetadataViews** - Defining the metadata structs relevant to an NFT's win/loss data and assigned moves.

* **GamePieceNFT** - This contract contains definitions for the gaming NFT, its collection, and an interface for escrowing resources. You'll also find a supporting resources & mechanisms for game name registration, proof of registration, and administrative resources and interfaces to manage the contract.

* **RockPaperScissorsGame** - As you might imagine, this contract contains the game's moves, logic as well as resource and interfaces defining the rules of engagement for two players in the course of a match. Additionally, receivers for Capabilities to matches are defined in `GamePlayer` resource and interfaces that allow players to create matches, be added and add others to matches, and engage with the matches they're in.

### **GamingMetadataViews**

This contract proposes a new set of [NFT metadata views](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft/blob/master/contracts/MetadataViews.cdc) for Gaming.
Gaming is a subdomain of `NFT`s, and it's' possible to imagine many different ways
that gaming-specific metadata can be generalized into shared metadata views.
There are countless types of gaming-related metadata that could be shared this way,
allowing third party apps or even other games to create unique experiences or metrics
using these interoperable pieces of data. This is possible because they are all
accessible via the `NFT` itself, and in many cases via the contract also!

As a proof of concept, we have defined a basic metadata view (`WinLossView`) to show the win/loss record (`BasicWinLoss` ) for an `NFT` for any game it participates in. It tracks wins, losses, and ties and exposes the ability to retrieve those values (stored in the game contract) directly from the `NFT` resource. While the implementation defined in this repo is very simple, you can imagine a more complex set of gaming metadata containing an `NFT`'s health and defense attributes, evolution characteristics, etc., making this pattern useful for any sort of game you might be designing.

The `WinLossView` maintains a mapping of game names to the game's respective `BasicWinLossRetriever`. A `BasicWinLossRetriever` is an interface defining a Capability with a function that can access `BasicWinLoss` data elsewhere. In this case, game contracts can maintain their own histories of NFT's `BasicWinLoss` so that they can create interesting metrics and records based on the data, allow anyone to retrieve any of the data easily from a central place, and also enable anyone with the NFT object itself or a reference to it to easily retrieve the data stored on it without directly relying on a central contract. 

Another benefit is that when a user submits their NFT to play a new game, the game can automatically add its win/loss record retriever to the NFT without an explicit confirmation from the user because the user has given permission implicitly.

It is the best of all worlds!

#### ***Considerations***

A consideration to note here on the side of the game developer is that the storage costs for this game data will be incurred on the account to which the game contract is deployed. For this, you get a public and central location which is very useful for building a leaderboard of `NFT`'s win/loss performance. 

Alternatively, you could construct an `NFT` so that the metadata would be stored on the NFT itself, but you would lose that in-built on-chain leaderboard and will need to consider if and how you'll want to enable that functionality. Some solutions involve maintaining off-chain (but verifiable) stats based on indexed events or simply requiring a user to pay for the storage themselves while maintaining a Capability to the `NFT`s that allows you to query their stats on a time interval.

### **GamePieceNFT**

As mentioned above, there can be many implementations of an `NFT` that would make it relevant for use in a game. Our `GamePieceNFT` is as minimal as possible so that it could be used in a number of simple games. Fundamentally, the `NFT` defined here serves to maintain a mechanism to retrieve the win/loss record for games in which it's been played. For a simple game like Rock, Paper, Scissors, something like the metadata defined in `GamingMetadataViews.BasicWinLoss` is sufficient. 

In order for all players to trust the validity of win/loss metadata, the metadata should only be mutable by the relevant game. Given this requirement, our `NFT` was implemented as a simple example demonstrating how an `NFT` could expose certain data to be mutated by authorized parties, but not it's owners. The `WinLossViews` metadata effectively serves as a pointer to the game which the metadata refers to, allowing the game to define the access and conditions under which the metadata could be altered.

Games can add their respective retrievers with `addWinLossRetriever()`, and the `NFT`'s `WinLossView` can be resolved using `resolveView()`. The simplest way to explain the storage patern of an `NFT`'s win/loss data is that the `NFT`'s `BasicWinLoss` is stored on the relevant game contract while the `NFT` stores a retriever that can access and return its `BasicWinLoss` record within that game.

The usual components of a standard `NFT` contract such as `Collection` and associated interface implementations are present as well.

In a departure from the centrally stored win/loss data, these NFTs expose the ability to store generic game moves (`gameMoves`) as a local attribute. An NFT's game moves, defined by the game contract, can be edited via an `NFTEscrow` implementing resource which allows games to add and remove moves to those NFTs it has in its escrow custody. 

Because these NFTs are generic enough to be used in a variety of games, the namespace to which a game has edit access is restricted to the name the game has registered for in the `GamePieceNFT` contract. Why do we require registration? Imagine if the game contract allowed any `NFTEscrow` implementing resource to edit NFT game moves simply by providing their game name - we don't want to simply trust that those resources would be honest and provide their associated name. So, we expose the edit functionality in a resource interface, additionally requiring proof of registration with the NFT contract. This proof of registration is what we call a `GameRegistrationTicket` which is returned to those who register with the game. On that ticket resource, we write down the name provided at the time of registration. Then, whenever an `NFTEscrow` resource edits moves we require a reference to that ticket so we can get the name from a resource we can trust, relying on the uniqueness guarantees inherent to Cadence resources instead of the honesty of actors.

Through this registration construction we not only get restricted access on registered namespace, but also a novel monetization mechanism for NFT creators. Registration can also be thought of a licensing as registering games must pay a fee. This fee limits spam vectors on the namespace while also serving as a potential income stream for the NFT contract.

Due to the financial nature of fee based registration, a `Administrator` resource was implemented along with interfaces relevant to distinct functions. `FundsAdmin` exposes financial related methods, `MintingAdmin` minting related functionality, and `RegistryAdmin` game name registration functions.

#### ***Considerations***

For this proof of concept, we did not find a `Minter` resource necessary, but anyone referring to this design should consider if they find such a resource necessary for things like rate-limiting, allowing/disallowing minting, accepting tokens to authorize minting of a new token, etc.

Additionally, the assignment of move related attributes on this version of the NFT could serve as a model for how one might store win/loss data in a distributed manner. One could replace or add methods to `NFTEscrow` enabling implementing resources to increment win/loss values on the NFT directly, and forego a retriever altogether. This is a per use case design decision worth considering, as distributed storage of win/loss data compromises easily queriable on-chain historic gameplay data among all players for the benefit of less costly game contract storage.

### **RockPaperScissorsGame**

All the of above components are pulled together in this smart contract implementation of single-round match Rock, Paper, Scissors. Again, this is a simple proof of concept that will hopefully illuminate the power of Cadence and Flow for the purpose of game development on-chain.

Before getting into the contract level details, let's first cover the basic gameplay setup defined here. The idea is that two players engage in a single round of Rock, Paper, Scissors where Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock > ... and so on. A match is mediated by a central game client that coordinates the match and submits moves on behalf of both players. Once the match has been created, the players submit their `NFT`s so that the game can record the match win/loss history of that `NFT`. After the moves are submitted by the match administrator, a winner is decided, win/loss results are recorded, and the `NFT`s are returned to their owners.

Now let's go over what that looks like in the contract. In broad strokes, each `GamePlayer` maintains a mapping of `Match.id` to `MatchLobbyActions` and another of `Match.id` to `MatchPlayerActions`. Their `MatchLobbyActions` allows the player to `escrowNFTToMatch()` (which must occur by both players before a match can be played) and `returnPlayerNFTs()`, which simply returns the escrowed NFTs to the `NonFungibleToken.Receiver` passed upon escrow deposit (assuming the match is over or has timed out).

The pattern outlined above allows a `GamePlayer` to create a `Match` via `GamePlayer.createMatch()`, saving the new `Match` to the contract's account storage, and linking `MatchLobbyActions` and `MatchPlayerActions` to the contracts account's private storage. When creating a `Match`; however, a player must also escrow their NFT providing also their `NonFungibleToken.Receiver`. Requiring "skin in the game", so to speak, helps to minimize the spam vector where an attacker can simply create an arbitrary number of Matches to take up account storage. Once the player's NFT has been escrowed to the `Match`, a `MatchPlayerActions` Capability is returned and is added to the `GamePlayer`'s `matchPlayerCapabilities`. 

To add a `GamePlayer` to a match, the player could call `signUpForMatch()` with the desired `matchID` which would add the `MatchLobbyActions` to the `GamePlayer`'s `matchLobbyCapabilities`. Alternatively, the `GamePlayerPublic` interface exposes the ability for a `GamePlayer` to be added to a `Match` by anyone. 

Once a match has been set up, two NFTs must be escrowed. Then each player can submit moves via `MatchPlayerActions.submitMoves()`, requiring both the move and a reference to the player's `GamePlayerID` Capability. We require this reference since both players have access to the same Capability, exposing a cheating vector whereby one player could submit the other player's move if the contract lacked a mechanism for identity verification. Since access control is a matter of what you have (not who you are) in Cadence, we take a reference to this `GamePlayerID` Capability and pull the submitting player's id from the reference (which should be kept private by the player).

Upon second player's asynchronous move submission, the `Match`:

1. determines the winner
2. alters the `BasicWinLoss` metadata of the `NFT` in `winLossRecords` based on the outcome
3. returns the escrowed `NFT`s to the respective `Receiver`s

>Note that a `Match` can only be utilized once.
Taking a look at the contract, you'll see that the core logic of Rock, Paper, Scissors is exposed in the contract function `determineRockPaperScissorsWinner()`. This was done intentionally in hopes that the core logic could be used in other variations. You could imagine another contract that defines a `Match` resource using other `NFT`s or that combines logic of a hypothetical tic-tac-toe game or that runs for multiple rounds and requires a buy-in from players which goes to the winner. Again, this is designed to be built on by the Flow community, so have fun with it and make building the game part of the fun!

#### ***Considerations***

A primary concern for us in the construction of this game is improving the UX such that a player wouldn't have to submit transactions for each move. This is a core problem for smart contract powered gaming, and likely something that requires changes to the protocol's on-chain account representation and/or higher levels of abstraction around account associations and identity.

A potential workaround in Cadence at present is a Capabilities-based approach, where I create a Capability that exposes restricted access to my `GamePlayer` resource and give that to some trusted agent - say a game client. Then, I tell that game client what transaction to submit for me using that Capability. For a number of reasons, we've decided against this approach, but primarily due to Capabilities' present lack of auditability.

That's all to say that we recognize this problem, many minds are working on it, and the UX will vastly improve in coming months. For the purpose of this proof of concept, we've chosen to move forward with the base contract components upon which we can soon build that seamless UX.

### Happy Path Walkthrough

With the context and components explained, we can more closely examine how they interact in a full user interaction. For simplicity, we'll assume everything goes as it's designed and walk the happy path.

1. User onboarding in a single transaction - `onboard_player.cdc`
    1. Setup `GamePieceNFT.Collection` & link Capabilities
    1. Mint `GamePieceNFT.NFT`
    1. Setup `RockPlayerScissorsGame.GamePlayer` & link Capabilities
1. Gameplay
    1. Player one creates a new match, escrowing their NFT and adding Player two
        1. Game moves are added to their NFT if they don't currently exists
    1. Player two escrows their NFT into the match
        1. Game moves are added to their NFT if they don't currently exists
    1. Each player submits their move
        1. A winner is determined
        1. The win/loss records are recorded for each NFT
        1. Each NFT is returned to their respective owners

## TODO - Transaction Diagrams

## Edge Case Resolution

#### **NFTs are escrowed, but the moves are never submitted**

Since a match timeout is specified upon `Match` creation and retrieval of `NFT`s is contingent on either the timeout being reached or the `Match` no longer being in play, a player can easily retrieve their `NFT` after timeout by calling `returnPlayerNFTs()` on their `MatchPlayerActions` Capability.

Since this Capability is linked on the game contract account which shouldnâ€™t not have active keys, the user can be assured that the Capability will not be unlinked. Additionally, since the method deposits the `NFT` to the `Receiver` provided upon escrow, they can be assured that it will not be accessible to anyone else calling `returnPlayerNFTs()`.

#### **NFTs are escrowed, but player unlinks their `Receiver` Capability before the NFT could be returned**

In this edge case, the `Receiver` Capability provided upon escrowing would no longer be linked to the depositing playerâ€™s `Collection`. Such an edge case is not handled in this version of the game, but should be considered to avoid permanent loss of their `NFT` should this situation occur.

## Demo on Emulator Using Flow CLI

To demo the functionality of this repo, clone it and follow the steps below by entering each command using [Flow CLI](https://github.com/onflow/flow-cli) from the package root:

### TODO - consolidate onboarding transaction to include child account creation & on-chain association

1. Single player

    1. Create account - account name: parent-main
    ```
    flow accounts create
    ```

    1. Mint Flow to the new account
    ```
    flow transactions send ./transactions/flowToken/mint_tokens.cdc 01cf0e2f2f715450 100.0
    ```

    1. Generate a public, private key pair - you'll want to copy the generated public key
    ```
    flow keys generate
    ```

    1. Onboard the new user with a `GamePieceNFT.Collection` & `ChildAccount.ChildAccountManager` with a child account, passing the generated public key & initial funding amount we'll pass from the parent to the child account.
    ```
    flow transactions send ./transactions/onboarding/onboard_new_user.cdc <PUBLIC_KEY> 10.0 RPSClient "Child account used for RockPaperScissors web app" "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR2KvcOwctyase2_P7lQxbxIutmLKFPch6rNw&usqp=CAU" "https://www.cheezewizards.com/" --signer parent-main
    ```

    1. The child account will then be created. You will want to add this account to your `flow.json` in [advanced format](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/configuration#advanced-format-1). Be sure to find the child address (likely `0x179b6b1cb6755e31`) in the emitted events and input the previously generated private key under the account's `privateKey` attribute in the `flow.json`. You will also want to add an alias for the `parent-main` account's private key since that account also has key access to the newly created `child` account. The `accounts` attribute in your `flow.json` should look like this:
    ```
    "accounts": {
		"emulator-account": {
			"address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
			"key": "<EMULATOR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY>"
		},
		"parent-main": {
			"address": "01cf0e2f2f715450",
			"key": "<PARENT_MAIN_PRIVATE_KEY>"
		},
		"child": {
			"address": "0x179b6b1cb6755e31",
			"key": {
				"type": "hex",
				"index": 0,
				"signatureAlgorithm": "ECDSA_P256",
				"hashAlgorithm": "SHA3_256",
				"privateKey": "7a6ec48770fa674713d10b244c1d4ba14aa13b269aa1b6bf3e110f827168f107"
			}
		},
		"parent-child": {
			"address": "0x179b6b1cb6755e31",
			"key": {
				"type": "hex",
				"index": 1,
				"signatureAlgorithm": "ECDSA_P256",
				"hashAlgorithm": "SHA3_256",
				"privateKey": "<PARENT_MAIN_PRIVATE_KEY>"
			}
		}
	}
    ```

    1. Onboard the child account, as this is the account a game client would be using to interact with the game contracts on behalf of the user. This will give the child account a `GamePieceNFT.Collection` & `NFT` as well as a `RockPaperScissorsGame.GamePlayer` so they can interact with the game via their child account. While these assets will reside in the child account, the user can transfer them to their parent account at any point (we'll cover that later).
    ```
    flow transactions send ./transactions/onboarding/onboard_player.cdc --signer child
    ```

    1. Now let's play a single-player match, using the child account as a game client would...

        1. Create new Match
        ```
        flow transactions send ./transactions/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/setup_new_singleplayer_match.cdc 37 10 --signer child
        ```
        1. Submit moves
        ```
        flow transactions send ./transactions/rock_paper_scissors_game/game_player/submit_moves.cdc 39 0 --signer child
        ```
        1. Submit automated player moves
        ```
        flow transactions send transactions/rock_paper_scissors_game/submit_automated_player_move.cdc 39
        ```
        1. Check Win/Loss record
        ```
        flow scripts execute scripts/get_rps_win_loss.cdc 0x179b6b1cb6755e31 37
        ```

    1. Next we'll transfer assets from child account to parent account, signing with parent account
        
        1. To do this, we'll need to construct a [complex transaction](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/complex-transactions). Let's start by building our transaction & saving the payload.
        ```
        flow transactions build ./transactions/child_account/parent_claims_player_and_all_nfts.cdc --proposer parent-main --payer parent-main --authorizer parent-main --authorizer parent-child --filter payload --save parent_claims_player_and_all_nfts
        ```

        1. Then, we'll sign the transaction. Even though the `parent-main` account's single private key gives it access to both its account and the `child` account, we'll need to sign twice. That's because the chain doesn't care about accounts, it just wants to know that it got the right signature for the address to access the account. We do this by signing first with our `parent-main` and secondly with our `parent-child`. Looking back at the `flow.json` you'll see that both aliases have the same address, but the addresses they map to and their relative indexes tell `flow-cli` where to get the necessary signatures. This is not relevant to the demo, but helpful to know for these sorts of key setups. Let's finally sign that transaction...
        ```
        flow transactions sign parent_claims_player_and_all_nfts --signer parent-main --signer parent-child --filter payload --save parent_claims_player_and_all_nfts
        ```

        1. Now we can finally send the built & signed transaction
        ```
        flow transactions send-signed parent_claims_player_and_all_nfts
        ```

    1. And lastly, we'll get the win/loss record from the transferred NFT to show that the record stays with the NFT
    ```
    flow scripts execute scripts/get_rps_win_loss.cdc 01cf0e2f2f715450 37
    ```
